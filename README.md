# Arduino Energy Monitor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simiolabs/arduino-energy-node.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simiolabs/arduino-energy-node)

This program reads current and voltage from 1-6 sensors, calculates power consumption with EmonLib and sends the data to a monitor using Zigbee technology.
